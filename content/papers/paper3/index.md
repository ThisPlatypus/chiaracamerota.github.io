##### Abstract

The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming pervasive and with each new installation of the IoT platform legacy internal and external brokers have to be integrated. Internal brokers are those under the control of the platform, while external brokers are managed by third parties. Both brokers kind may be multiservice/multi-tenant and may manage multiple Data Models. The interoperable management of these complex networks has to pass from the IoT device registration which is typically a re-current operation since the IoT networks are in continuous evolution. In this paper, the above-mentioned problems have been addressed by the introduction of our concept of IoT Directory and reasoning tools to (i) manage Internal and External brokers,(ii) perform the automated registration by harvesting and reasoning of devices managed into external brokers single-or multi-tenant services,(iii) perform the automated registration and management of Data Models, and any custom Data Model. The solution has been developed and tested into Snap4City, an 100% open-source IoT platform for Smart Cities and Industry 4.0, the official FIWARE platform, EOSC, and lib of Node-RED. The specific IoT Directory has been developed in the context of the Herit-Data Project, the results have been validated in wide conditions of the whole Snap4City network of more than 18 tenants, and billions of data.
